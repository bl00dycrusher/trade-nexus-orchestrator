## Setup Instructions

### 1. Install Python Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Start the Bridge Server
```bash
python bridge_server.py
```
The server will start on `ws://localhost:8765`

### 3. Setup MT5 Expert Advisor
1. Copy `MT5_Bridge_EA.mq5` to your MT5 `MQL5/Experts/` folder
2. Compile the EA in MetaEditor
3. Attach to chart and configure parameters
4. Ensure WebSocket connections are allowed in MT5 settings

### 4. Setup cTrader cBot
1. Copy `cTrader_Bridge_cBot.cs` to your cTrader cBot project
2. Build the cBot in cTrader Automate
3. Add to chart and configure parameters
4. Ensure network access is allowed in cTrader settings

### 5. Access Web GUI
Start the React development server and access the web interface to manage accounts and relationships.

```sh
npm i
npm run dev
```

## Configuration

### Account Types
- **Provider**: Only sends trade signals to copyers
- **Copyer**: Only receives and executes trade signals
- **Both**: Can both send and receive trade signals

### Relationships
Configure which Provider accounts send signals to which Copyer accounts, including volume multipliers for risk management.

## Security Considerations

- The system runs on localhost by default
- For production use, implement proper authentication
- Use SSL/TLS for encrypted connections
- Validate all incoming trade signals
- Implement proper error handling and logging

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues
1. Ensure bridge server is running
2. Check firewall settings
3. Verify WebSocket support in trading platforms
4. Check server logs for error messages

### Trade Execution Issues
1. Verify account permissions
2. Check symbol availability
3. Validate lot sizes and trading hours
4. Review magic number configuration
